# Hackerrank Solutions

This repository will be holding my solutions to Hackerrank challenges.<br>
I will try to maintain a 1-1 mapping with challenge names to a reasonable degree, however, some extremely simple challenges may be grouped together.

## Code style

The repository uses pylint for linting python code, and eslint for linting js/ts code.
I am maintaining this repo from VS Code, and the repo includes my settings as to facilitate environment replication. See setup.md for more.

## Testing

Hackerrank challenges do not require users to write test along the solutions. Despite that, sometimes I will opt to include simple tests with the code.<br>
These tests will likely not cover all cases nor all code since:

- Hackerrank itself forces code to be tested against a reasonable set of tests in the website, making tests in this repo somewhat redundant.
- attempting to do so would take away too much focus from solving the challenges.

_Unless otherwise specified, these tests do not align with frameworks such as Jest or pytest._
